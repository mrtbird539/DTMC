# Project 3: Dude, There;'s My Car! (DTMC)

## Description

Our project 3 is a full-stack MERN application centered around and tailored to the car community: people who are very passionate about their cars, collect cars, constantly update and customize their cars. Dude, There's My Car! is an online social platform where people can come together to show off their cars and look at other people's cars. You can browse through different profiles, search based on make, model, or year of a car and are able to see any other special information the user decides to post about the car.

Our main motivation for making this application was to find something that we all had in common and something that we were passionate about. We all drive cars, we are all proud of the work we have put into each of our cars, and we wanted a centralized place to show them off. We felt that we would be able to make a better looking, working, and more long lasting application if we all found something we were passionate about and had a genuine interest in. 

We styled the app around giving the user the ablility to show off every aspect of their car from the make and model of it to any addidtional or special customizations they have added since owning the car. We wanted to make the application simple and easy to use so the user does not get easily confused as to where to find certain pages while using the application. We also wanted to give the user a place to show all of their cars on one page, thus, the personal "garage" each user has on their profile page. 

For each post that the user creates we gave them ample space and ability to show the different aspects and customizations; whether it be simple cosmetic changes or a whole new engine under the hood. The user also has the ability to post photos of their car along with the description to give other app users a better understanding of what the car looks like. 

While doing this project our group learned that connecting the back end to the front end and having the app run the way it should was a big hurdle to overcome. Since this was our first full-stack MERN application while working with a group, it took some getting used to with the way everything is connected. Also the fact that we all agreed to use Typescript for this project took a little more time of us all reading over the documentation, articles, and even YouTube videos as well as seeking out our professor and TA's help after we exhausted all options on our own. We knew taking the time to learn and work with a full-stack MERN application using typescript would be worth it for the outcome of this project and for future projects with our future employers as well.
